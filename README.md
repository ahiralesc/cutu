Cluster Usage Trace utilities (CUT-Utilities)


CUT utilities have been design to extract, process, transform, and analyze job and task execution traces. We are adding functionality for several formats:
-   GCUT, [Google Cluster Usage Traces](https://github.com/google/cluster-data)
-   SWF, [Standard Workload Format](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/parallel/workload/logs.html)
-   GSWF, [Grid Standard Workload Format](http://gwa.ewi.tudelft.nl/)

Most of the code for processing SWF files was written in Java.
