# Cluster Usare Trace utilities (CUTu)

The CUTu utilities were design to extract and prepare data for the following file formats:
- GCUT, [Google Cluster Usage Traces](https://github.com/google/cluster-data)
- SWF, [Standard Workload Archive](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/parallel/workload/logs.html), Standard Workload Format (SWF) workloads.
- GSWF, [Grid Workload Archive](http://gwa.ewi.tudelft.nl/), Grid Workload Format (GWF) workloads.


We are rewriting much of the code from Java to C++ and building workload support for data extraction and analysis of the previous formatted workloads.
